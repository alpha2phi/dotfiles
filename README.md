## Neovim configuration fork of apha2phi
To get started, read my [Medium article](https://alpha2phi.medium.com/neovim-init-lua-e80f4f136030).

In order to get started with the new lua way I dared to copy and adapt this very decent config,
which honestly I couldn't have done on my own.

I mixed in the statusbar galaxyline config of th3Whit3W0lf, which again, was beyond my available time/effort/capabilities ...
I basically adapted it to my customs and will be doing so as an ongoing effort ...
